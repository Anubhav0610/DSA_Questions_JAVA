Here is a simple Java program to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion:
Javapublic class Factorial {
    // Recursive method to calculate factorial
    public static int factorial(int n) {
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return 1; // Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
        }
        return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive call
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 5; // Example number
        System.out.println("Factorial of " + number + " is: " + factorial(number));
    }
}

Explanation:

Base Case: If n is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1.
Recursive Case: The method calls itself with n-1 until it reaches the base case.
Output: For number = 5, the output will be:Factorial of 5 is: 120
